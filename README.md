# Lieferando

The following repository contains reverse backend structures from Takeaway.com / Lieferando.de
This allows the user to place orders, track the orders or perform other actions

## What it does
The following program creates one / or more requests to the server & allows an order without ever having opened the page.  
**Warning:** It could well be that you get ratelimited after too many orders.

## How it works
Compile & Run. Now you only have to enter the desired data & the order is ready.
Currently the order menus are hardcoded, but this can be customized in no time.

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.
